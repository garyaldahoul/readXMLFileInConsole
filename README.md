# Console Write Data to SQL DB

I used .NET 7 & SQL databases for this solution where it read the data from XML file and write the data to DB then show the target in the Console.

### Running the code 
To run it locally clone the project and checkout to insert-xml-DB-Console and open the project in Visual Studio and upload these packages[`System.Data.SqlClient`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`] .
you should to connect with SQL database (Docker Desktop - Azure platform for mac )
then click run.
