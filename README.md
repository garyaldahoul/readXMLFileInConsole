# Enter ID in Console

This solution has been done same as  Show target in Console where I used .NET 7 for this solution where it read the data from XML file then you enter the ID value and it will  show the relevant data  in the Console.
### Running the code 
To run it locally clone the project and checkout to simple-xml-enterID and open the project in Visual Studio then click run then enter an ID.
